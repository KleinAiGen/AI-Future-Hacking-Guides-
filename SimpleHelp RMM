    $process = Get-Process -Name $processName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

    if ($null -eq $process) {
        Write-Host "Process $processName is NOT running."
        Exit 1 # Indicate an error/alert condition
    } else {
        Write-Host "Process $processName is running."
        Exit 0 # Indicate success
    }

    Configure Output Matching: Set the monitor to trigger an alert if the script's exit code is 1.

    Assign Alert: Link this monitor to an alert definition that sends a notification to the relevant technicians.

This example illustrates the power of scripting within SimpleHelp to create highly specific monitoring solutions beyond the built-in options.
